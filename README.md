Corn (maize) is a very important crop in the US. Recently (2017), a new corn disease was identified in Michigan named Tar Spot, caused by Phyllachora maydis. This obligate fungus causes small, raised black lesions on corn leaves. In some instances, a halo of necrotic tissue develops around these black P. maydis lesions forming what is known as a "fish eye" lesion. Previous reports have indicated that the fungus Monographella maydis is responsible for these fish eye lesions, which can have an even more significant impact on yield. M. maydis can be cultured, however, recent attempts to isolate M. maydis from fish eye lesions in Michigan have been unsuccessful. Other fungal species have been cultured from these lesions, but not M. maydis.

The goal of this project is to determine what fungal species are associated with tar spot lesions, and what fungal species are associated with fish eye lesions. We aim to compare the fungal communities surrounding these two distinct symptom types. We hypothesize that P. maydis will be the most present OTU in all samples, as both symptoms require a raised black lesion caused by P. maydis. We hypothesize that fish-eye lesions will also contain the presence of fungal species not found in tar-spot only lesions. We hypothesize that one of these fungal species will be M. maydis. If we do not find evidence of M. maydis, we hope to find other fungal taxa that are candidate causal agents of the fish eye symptoms.

In order to analyze this data, you will need 3 files:
1) otu_table_ITS_UPARSE_R1.txt
2) consensus_taxonomy_phyllachora_Msorghi.txt
3) TNF_map.txt

Save them wherever you want, and change the path to where you saved them so that R can find them.
